## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and access control using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    * **JWT Creation (`/jwt`):** Issues a JWT token upon successful authentication, setting it as an HTTP-only cookie.
    * **User Logout (`/logout`):** Clears the authentication cookie to log users out.
    * **Token Verification (`varifyToken` middleware):** Protects routes by validating the JWT from incoming requests.
* **User Management (`/user`):**
    * **User Creation:** Allows new users to be registered in the database.
    * **User Retrieval:** Fetches user details, including an aggregated list of `enrolledCourseIds` by performing a `$lookup` with the `enrollments` collection.
    * **User Update:** Updates existing user profiles.
* **Category Management (`/category`, `/categories`):**
    * **Category Creation:** Adds new course categories.
    * **Category Retrieval:** Fetches all categories, with options for `limit`, `sortBy`, and `orderBy` (e.g., `createdAt` for sorting).
* **Course Management (`/course`, `/courses`):**
    * **Course Creation:** Adds new courses to the platform.
    * **Single Course Retrieval (`/course/:id`):** Fetches detailed information for a specific course, including aggregated `numberOfReview` and `averageRating` by performing a `$lookup` with the `reviews` collection.
    * **All Courses Retrieval (`/course` or `/courses`):** Fetches a list of all courses.
    * **Filtered/Sorted Courses (`/courses` with query parameters):** Supports filtering by `free`/`price` or `category`, and allows sorting by various fields (e.g., `createdAt`) with `limit` and `orderBy` options. This uses a comprehensive aggregation pipeline.
    * **Mentor-Specific Courses (`/courses/:uid`):** Retrieves courses posted by a specific mentor, protected by `varifyToken` to ensure authorized access.
    * **Course Update:** Modifies existing course details.
    * **Course Deletion:** Removes courses from the database.
* **Review Management (`/review`, `/reviewsByCourseId/:id`):**
    * **Review Creation:** Allows users to submit reviews for courses.
    * **Reviews by Course ID:** Fetches all reviews for a specific course, including reviewer `displayName` and `photoURL` by performing a `$lookup` with the `user` collection.
    * **Review Deletion:** Deletes a specific review.
* **Enrollment Management (`/enrollment`, `/enrollments/:uid`):**
    * **Enroll/Unenroll (`/enrollment` with `enroll` status):** Handles both enrollment and unenrollment of users in courses using **MongoDB transactions** to ensure data consistency across `enrollments`, `courses` (incrementing/decrementing `totalEnrollment` and `RemainingSeat`), and `user` collections (incrementing/decrementing `totalEnrolled` and adding/removing `enrolledCourseIds`).
    * **User Enrollments (`/enrollments/:uid`):** Fetches all enrollments for a specific user, including details of the enrolled courses.
    * **Enrollment Deletion:** Allows the removal of an enrollment record.
* **Blog Management (`/blog`, `/blogs`):**
    * **Blog Post Creation:** Allows the addition of new blog posts.
    * **Blog Post Retrieval:** Fetches all blog posts, including the author's display name and photo.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The LearnOsphere backend is built with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and security.

* **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building robust APIs.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing all application data.
    * **`MongoClient` & `ServerApiVersion`:** Directly interacts with MongoDB for database operations.
    * **`ObjectId`:** Used for handling MongoDB's unique document identifiers.
    * **Transactions:** Employed for critical operations like enrollment/unenrollment to maintain data integrity across multiple collections.
* **JSON Web Token (`jsonwebtoken`):** For secure authentication and authorization, handling token signing and verification.
* **CORS (`cors`):** Middleware configured to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing from specified frontend origins (`http://localhost:5173`, `https://learn-osphere.web.app`).
* **Dotenv (`dotenv`):** For loading environment variables (like `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`) from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive information out of the codebase.
* **Cookie-parser (`cookie-parser`):** Middleware for parsing cookies attached to the client request object, essential for handling JWTs stored as HTTP-only cookies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the backend server up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. **MongoDB** should also be installed and running.

* **Node.js & npm:**
    ```bash
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```
* **MongoDB:** [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

### Running the Server

1.  Create a **`.env`** file in the root of your project and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_USER=your_mongodb_username
    DB_PASS=your_mongodb_password
    JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    NODE_ENV=development # or production
    ```
    * `PORT`: The port your backend server will run on (defaulting to 3000 if not specified).
    * `DB_USER` & `DB_PASS`: Your MongoDB Atlas cluster username and password.
    * `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`: A strong, random string for signing JWTs. **Generate a complex one for production!**
    * `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` in production environments for secure cookie handling (`secure` and `sameSite` settings).
2.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
